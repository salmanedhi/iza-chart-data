Literature and the Arts have the least representation of women in their departments - 20 % and 30 % respectively . Compared to STEM-related departments such as Computer Science 60 % , Maths 55 % and Engineering 70 % .
Engineering was the department in which women were best represented with 70 % ; the least was literature itself with just over 20 % and the arts slightly more with just over 30 % . Computer science was also well represented by women seeing a 60 % representation rate which would suggest traditonally male dominated departments are now well represented by women .

The percentage of women in law firms is 35 % compared with 50 % in financial , 62 % in technology and 65 % in insurance . \\n Again , the y axis is not clearly labelled - I assume it is percentage of women .
The chart compares the percentage of female representation across different sectors . Whilst insurance and tech sectors are leading the charge at over 60 % , law firms are farther behind around 35 % .
The graph shows the representation of woman in different sectors . This shows that women are less likely to be employed by law firms than financial groups , tech and insurance .
