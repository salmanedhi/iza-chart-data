The title tells us this chart shows women representation in Law Firms . The graph actually shows female representation in a variety of sectors . \\n The intention appears to be to show that there is lower representation in Law firms , at 35 % , compared to 50 % + in other sectors . However I would say this chart is incorrectly titled .
