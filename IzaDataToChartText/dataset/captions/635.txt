The graph shows the least frequent daily users of social media . According to the graph , the least frequent users I gather to be the 35-44 age group at approx . 70 minutes spent on social media ( graph is n't clear what the minutes are ) , followed by 25-34 also around 70 minutes . Next the 55-64 age group is at approx . 110 minutes , the 15-24 group at approx 125 minutes and the most frequent group is the 45-54 age group at approx . 150 minutes ( per day I 'm assuming ) .
