This chart shows that university literature departments have 70 % women , followed by arts departments at 60 % . Engineering lags at 30 % followed by computer science at 20 % and mathematics at 10 % . \\n This is what the chart appears to show , however , the y axis is merely labelled percentage . This is , I assume , the percentage of women but could be the representation of men; the title is also slightly ambiguous .
