This chart shows the number of top 100 universities in each continent . America has the most top 100 universities at 50 , while Europe is 2nd at 30 and Asia 3rd at 20 . Australia and Africa have the lowest number of universities in the top 100 at 5 each . This could be interpreted as there being better education in America, however the data could also be inaccurate, as the Top 100 Universities list is made by an American company, therefore may be bias towards American institutions .
