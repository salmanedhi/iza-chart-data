The chart is titled closing stock prices in £ sterling for Akef Inc on Wednesday but includes data for five days , Monday to Friday . Whilst Wednesday showed the highest closing price of £ 74 , and Friday the lowest at around £ 9 it is difficult to say with any certainty that the data can be relied on given the confusion caused by the title of the chart .
