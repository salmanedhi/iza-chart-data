The chart displays data for six teams in a quiz competition and details the number of mistakes made by each team . The title and graphic representation are a little at odds , as the teams with the tallest bars were actually the least successful . Additionally the scale for the number of mistakes is hard to read with any precision as it suggests incorrect answers could be part of a whole number . Careful reading of the data shows that team Lovely made more than 8 mistakes but less than 10 and were therefore the least successful team in the quiz competition . The most successful team , team Fearless made less than 2 mistakes . Teams DIY and Cats made between 2 and 4 mistakes and teams ABC and Smart kids made between 4 and 6 mistakes .
