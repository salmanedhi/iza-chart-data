The chart shows cities in South America and compares their temperature . No indication of duration for the sample nor the dates the data was gathered . \n Belem had the highest temperature at about 36 degrees followed by Montevideo at 28 degrees , Lima at 25 degrees , Cordoba at 23 degrees , Santiago at 20 degrees and finally Bogota at 16 degrees . The data is of limited value for he reasons givne in my opening remarks .
