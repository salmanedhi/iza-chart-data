This chart shows that women are more represented in insurance , technology and financial groups than in law firms . The percentage of women in law firms is 35 % compared with 50 % in financial , 62 % in technology and 65 % in insurance . \\n Again , the y axis is not clearly labelled - I assume it is percentage of women .
