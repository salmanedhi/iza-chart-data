The chart shows the number of minutes people in equlised age ranges use social media . 45-54 year olds use social media the most at 150 minutes followed by 15-24 year old at about 123 minutes then the oldest group 55-64 year olds 115 minutes followed by the 25-34 and 35-44 group equally at about 70 minutes . \\n The lower end is expected but the upper end of the age range seems odd at first glance .
