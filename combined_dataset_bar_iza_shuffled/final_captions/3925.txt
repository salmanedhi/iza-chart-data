The chart is titled The least frequent daily users of social media . We have data recorded in minutes rather than number of uses and results are split into responses for five age range groups ; ages 15-24 , 25-34 , 35-44 , 45-54 and 55-64 . The scale for minutes is a little difficult to read with any accuracy due to the way it has been segmented but a rough idea of results can be found . Careful reading of the data shows that both the age group 25-34 and 35-44 recorded the same and overall lowest number of minutes at around 70 minutes each . The age group 45-54 recorded the highest number of minutes at around 150 per day .
